# Saturday Morning

This piece of music is farily straightforward in terms of its structure. To get to something very relaxing and laidback, I chose the combination between the hollow and piano sound and the slow beats per minute, lower octave as well as added transitions between sections. These all contribute to forming a more cohesive piece and building a relaxing atmosphere. The piece is made up of three main sections where each section is a brief melody of piano "soloing" and a chunk of chord progressions. The techniques aren't exactly complex, it was mostly while loops and alternating the sound effects.
